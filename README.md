## App Screenshots

<!-- You can use plain Markdown for images side by side, but for 6 images in a row, HTML is more reliable on GitHub. Reference the screenshots as: screenshots/1.png, screenshots/2.png, ..., screenshots/6.png --> <p align="center"> <img src="screenshots/1.png" width="130"> <img src="screenshots/2.png" width="130"> <img src="screenshots/3.png" width="130"> <img src="screenshots/4.png" width="130"> <img src="screenshots/5.png" width="130"> <img src="screenshots/6.png" width="130"> </p>
