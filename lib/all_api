The capture and death of Roger by the World Government brought a change throughout the world. His last words before his death revealed the location of the greatest treasure in the world, One Piece. It was this revelation that brought about the Grand Age of Pirates, men who dreamed of finding One Piece (which promises an unlimited amount of riches and fame), and quite possibly the most coveted of titles for the person who found it, the title of the Pirate King.<br><br>\\nEnter Monkey D. Luffy, a 17-year-old boy that defies your standard definition of a pirate. Rather than the popular persona of a wicked, hardened, toothless pirate who ransacks villages for fun, Luffy’s reason for being a pirate is one of pure wonder; the thought of an exciting adventure and meeting new and intriguing people, along with finding One Piece, are his reasons of becoming a pirate. Following in the footsteps of his childhood hero, Luffy and his crew travel across the Grand Line, experiencing crazy adventures, unveiling dark mysteries and battling strong enemies, all in order to reach One Piece.<br><br>\\n<b>*This includes following special episodes:</b><br>\\n- Chopperman to the Rescue!

Who will emerge to lead the team...and will they be able to out-muscle and out-ego everyone who stands in their way? <br>\\n<br>\\n(Source: Kodansha USA)<br>\\n<br>\\n<i>Note: The first episode received a pre-screening at the AnimagiC convention on August 6, 2022.</i>\",\n            \"aired_year\": \"2022\",\n            \"premiered\": null,\n            \"views\": 1212,\n            \"categories\": [\n                {\n                    \"anime\": 9,\n                    \"category\": 139,\n                    \"category_name\": \"Sports\",\n                    \"category_name_val\": \"sports\"\n                },\n                {\n                    \"anime\": 9,\n                    \"category\": 131,\n                    \"category_name\": \"Shounen\",\n                    \"category_name_val\": \"shounen\"\n                }\n            ],\n            \"studios\": [\n                {\n                    \"anime\": 9,\n                    \"studio\": 8,\n                    \"name\": \"8-bit\",\n                    \"name_val\": \"8bit\"\n                }\n            ],\n            \"producers\": [],\n            \"schedule_ep\": {\n                \"name\": \"Blue Lock\",\n                \"day\": \"Saturday\",\n                \"date\": \"18 Mar\",\n                \"time\": \"04:30 PM\",\n                \"is_show\": true\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": 19,\n            \"name\": \"Detective Conan\",\n            \"japanese_name\": \"Meitantei Conan\",\n            \"english_name\": \"Case Closed\",\n            \"thumbnail\": null,\n            \"image\": \"/media/https%3A/cdnimg.xyz/cover/detective-conan.png\",\n            \"image_high_quality\": \"https://cdnimg.xyz/cover/detective-conan.png\",\n            \"ani_image\": \"https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/media/anime/cover/large/bx235-XucEZpR3CRaV.jpg\",\n            \"banner\": \"https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/media/anime/banner/235-MTmiz0uB0fMd.jpg\",\n            \"type\": \"S\",\n            \"anime_watch_type\": \"S\",\n            \"status\": \"O\",\n            \"active\": true,\n            \"episodes\": \"1072\",\n            \"episodes_till_now\": \"1077\",\n            \"rating_age\": \"81\",\n            \"duration\": \"25\",\n            \"description\": \"Kudo Shinichi is a seventeen year-old high school detective whom people call the \\\"Modern Sherlock Holmes.\\\" However, one night after a date with his childhood sweetheart, Ran, Shinichi witnessed an illegal trade and, caught off his guard, was knocked unconscious and fed a drug that was supposed to kill him... but he woke up and found himself shrunken to a seven year-old.

Luffy, a 17-year-old boy that defies your standard definition of a pirate.

Following in the footsteps of his childhood hero, Luffy and his crew travel across the Grand Line, experiencing crazy adventures, unveiling dark mysteries and battling strong enemies, all in order to reach One Piece.<br><br>\\n<b>*This includes following special episodes:</b><br>\\n- Chopperman to the Rescue!

Given 10 days to attempt to grab Lum's horns, Ataru realizes how impossible the challenge is as he is faced with Lum's extraterrestrial powers.Motivated by a promise of marriage from his childhood friend Shinobu Miyake, Ataru manages to catch Lum off guard. He mistakenly grabs hold of her bikini top first, but he eventually achieves his true goal. Although the game is over, Lum misunderstands that she is the one whom Ataru wants to marry, and she decides to move in with him. The poor student constantly tries to shake off the clingy Lum while doing his best to reconcile with his desired fiancée. After Ataru's heroic feat results in such a disastrous outcome, it is questionable whether luck will ever be on his side.\",\n            \"aired_year\": \"2022\",\n            \"premiered\": null,\n            \"views\": null,\n            \"categories\": [\n                {\n                    \"anime\": 12752,\n                    \"category\": 131,\n                    \"category_name\": \"Shounen\",\n                    \"category_name_val\": \"shounen\"\n                },\n                {\n                    \"anime\": 12752,\n                    \"category\": 138,\n                    \"category_name\": \"Sci-Fi\",\n                    \"category_name_val\": \"scifi\"\n                },\n                {\n                    \"anime\": 12752,\n                    \"category\": 124,\n                    \"category_name\": \"Romance\",\n                    \"category_name_val\": \"romance\"\n                },\n                {\n                    \"anime\": 12752,\n                    \"category\": 168,\n                    \"category_name\": \"Gag Humor\",\n                    \"category_name_val\": \"gag-humor\"\n                },\n                {\n                    \"anime\": 12752,\n                    \"category\": 122,\n                    \"category_name\": \"Comedy\",\n                    \"category_name_val\": \"comedy\"\n                }\n            ],\n            \"studios\": [],\n            \"producers\": [],\n            \"schedule_ep\": {}\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": 12748,\n            \"name\": \"Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008) (Dub)\",\n            \"japanese_name\": \"\",\n            \"english_name\": \"Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008) (Dub)\",\n            \"thumbnail\": null,\n            \"image\": \"/media/https%3A/cdnimg.xyz/cover/star-wars-the-clone-wars-2008-dub.png\",\n            \"image_high_quality\": \"https://cdnimg.xyz/cover/star-wars-the-clone-wars-2008-dub.png\",\n            \"ani_image\": null,\n            \"banner\": null,\n            \"type\": \"D\",\n            \"anime_watch_type\": \"M\",\n            \"status\": \"C\",\n            \"active\": true,\n            \"episodes\": \"1\",\n            \"episodes_till_now\": \"1\",\n            \"rating_age\": null,\n            \"duration\": null,\n            \"description\": \"After the Republic's victory on Christophsis, Anakin and his new apprentice, Ahsoka Tano, must rescue the kidnapped son of Jabba the Hutt.

From time to time, monsters called Zaiju (Beasts of Sin) appear and attack Hinomori, the town where Haruka lives. But the Heart Princesses are there to fight the monsters. Haruka looks up to these princesses who protect the people of Hinomori from the Zaiju, wishing that she too could be a princess someday. Then one day, when she is working on the script at home, a mysterious cat named Jin comes to her and says, “You seem to have the right qualities to be a princess. What do you think? Would you become a princess?”\\n<br><br>\\n<i>Note: The first episode of the anime was unfinished at airing time.

Eiko happens to have blue eyes from her American father, and her classmates make no attempt to rein in their bullying. Other than Eiko's homeroom teacher Akiko, even the teachers view Eiko the same way that the children do.

The capture and death of Roger by the World Government brought a change throughout the world. His last words before his death revealed the location of the greatest treasure in the world, One Piece. It was this revelation that brought about the Grand Age of Pirates, men who dreamed of finding One Piece (which promises an unlimited amount of riches and fame), and quite possibly the most coveted of titles for the person who found it, the title of the Pirate King.<br><br>\\nEnter Monkey D. Luffy, a 17-year-old boy that defies your standard definition of a pirate. Rather than the popular persona of a wicked, hardened, toothless pirate who ransacks villages for fun, Luffy’s reason for being a pirate is one of pure wonder; the thought of an exciting adventure and meeting new and intriguing people, along with finding One Piece, are his reasons of becoming a pirate. Following in the footsteps of his childhood hero, Luffy and his crew travel across the Grand Line, experiencing crazy adventures, unveiling dark mysteries and battling strong enemies, all in order to reach One Piece.<br><br>\\n<b>*This includes following special episodes:</b><br>\\n- Chopperman to the Rescue!

Intrigued by its appearance, Light reads the first few sentences, only to find out that it states that anyone whose name is written inside will die. Discarding it as a joke, Light continues his daily activities. Soon after though, his human curiosity takes the better of him and prompts Light to try the notebook, discovering the truth behind first sentence. Now, with power in his hands, Yagami Light is on a quest to change the world and become God of the New World. His path to holy status won't be easy however, as another genius, known as L, is working against Light's beliefs and Light himself.

The capture and death of Roger by the World Government brought a change throughout the world. His last words before his death revealed the location of the greatest treasure in the world, One Piece. It was this revelation that brought about the Grand Age of Pirates, men who dreamed of finding One Piece (which promises an unlimited amount of riches and fame), and quite possibly the most coveted of titles for the person who found it, the title of the Pirate King.<br><br>\\nEnter Monkey D. Luffy, a 17-year-old boy that defies your standard definition of a pirate. Rather than the popular persona of a wicked, hardened, toothless pirate who ransacks villages for fun, Luffy’s reason for being a pirate is one of pure wonder; the thought of an exciting adventure and meeting new and intriguing people, along with finding One Piece, are his reasons of becoming a pirate. Following in the footsteps of his childhood hero, Luffy and his crew travel across the Grand Line, experiencing crazy adventures, unveiling dark mysteries and battling strong enemies, all in order to reach One Piece.<br><br>\\n<b>*This includes following special episodes:</b><br>\\n- Chopperman to the Rescue!
